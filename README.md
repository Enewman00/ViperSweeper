#### The game is played just like normal minesweeper. You click a square and the empty squares around it are revealed.
#### If a square has a number in it, that is the number of mines (or vipers in this case) in the direct vicinity.
#### If you (left) click on a viper, you lose. If you flag all of the vipers (right click), you win!

## How to run the program
There's an executable jar file called "ViperSweeper.jar". Just run that to play the game.
